#im sorry I don't wanna deal with branches and merge conflcts plus we not writing heavy in depth code 
# so for practice just use your file and whatever, and then when we discuss after we are done practicing we can figure out what parts we want to use for demo and make a good final version for the demo. 

# or we can probably do multiple files for the demo lowkey? that way we don't waste time commenting and uncommenting stuff. 

# idk just word vomit gangy, but for now just practice in your ruby file
